# AI Vibe Code

AI Vibe Code is an interactive AI-powered code project builder and editor designed for rapid prototyping, UI customization, and live previewing of web projects. It leverages advanced AI models (such as Puter AI and Gemini API) to assist users in creating, editing, and customizing web applications with ease.

## Features

### 1. AI-Assisted UI Planning and Generation
- **Conversational UI Design:** Users can describe the content and layout preferences for their projects, such as "I want to build a modern e-commerce website." The AI then generates a tailored plan or code (See ![image1](image1)).
- **Content & Aesthetic Guidance:** Prompts help users specify content sections (About Me, Projects, Skills, Contact) and design preferences (color, layout, style).

### 2. Project Templates & Creation
- **Project Wizard:** Easily create new projects with a guided modal. Choose from templates like Blank Project, Landing Page, Portfolio, Blog, Dashboard, or Puter App (See ![image2](image2)).
- **Custom Project Naming:** Assign unique names to projects or use defaults.
- **Code Folder Upload:** Option to upload an existing codebase for AI-powered editing.

### 3. Live Code Editor & Preview
- **Split View:** The interface displays a code editor, customization controls, and a live website preview, enabling instant feedback on changes (See ![image3](image3)).
- **HTML/CSS/JS Support:** Edit and see effects in real time, supporting rapid iteration.

### 4. Visual Editing and Style Controls
- **Element Editor:** Select elements in the preview to modify text, colors, dimensions, alignment, font family, and more using visual controls (See ![image4](image4)).
- **Custom CSS Rules:** Directly add or modify CSS properties for granular design control.
- **AI Modifications:** Enter natural language commands for AI to suggest or apply design and layout changes.

### 5. AI-Driven Modifications
- **Modify by Prompt:** Users can request changes (e.g., "mobile version") and let the AI update the site’s layout or code accordingly (See ![image4](image4)).
- **One-Click Edits:** Apply changes manually or let the AI handle multiple edits at once.

### 6. Multi-Provider AI Support
- **Switch AI Models:** The app supports multiple AI providers (e.g., Puter AI, Gemini API) for different types of generation and assistance (See ![image2](image2), ![image3](image3)).

### 7. User Experience
- **Intuitive Controls:** Easy-to-use sidebars for project and element management.
- **Live Feedback:** All changes are applied live and visible instantly in the preview pane.

4. **Preview Live:** Instantly see your changes reflected in the live preview window.
5. **Iterate with AI:** Use prompts to request new layouts, mobile versions, or style changes via AI.
